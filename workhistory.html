      <h3>Photographer</h3>

      <p>I've been in photography for about a decade now. Pretty over it at this point, but I still shoot product for Harry & David every few weeks. I don't take pictures much as a hobby anymore. I think doing it as a job changed my relationship to it a bit.</p>

      <h3>Ops Coordinator</h3>
      <a href="https://www.heartroasters.com/"><img src="imgs/heart.jpg" width= 100% alt="A screenshot of Heart Roasters' website"></a>
      <p>I just left my position as Operations Coodinator at the Heart Coffee roastery. I was here for a little over four years. Loved this job so much! Hated to move on from it, but for a few reasons it was pretty necessary.</p>

      <p>When I moved to Portland from Alaska in 2009, I briefly attended the Art Institute of Portland, and then worked at the Icebreaker store across from Powell's for about three years. </p>
