    <h3>Excerpt from a screenplay I'm working on about my childhood in Southeast Alaska</h3>

    <p>EXT. WIDE SHOT - HOUSE, then pan to WORKSHOP 
    <br>
    <br>
    House and workshop are blanketed in snow, with a shoveled path connecting them. Both buildings are painted red with white trim. Colored string lights are draped along the porch railing of the house.

    INT. DAD’S WORKSHOP - DUSKY EVENING LIGHT
    <br>
    <br>
    MOVING SHOT - Arthur alters a slip for the life-sized doll sitting on the workbench. He reaches for a spool of thread on a shelf above the window, and the shot pulls back behind him and explores the shop.
    <br>
    <br>
    The doll is the size of a tall adult woman, and has long black hair and a beautiful painted face made of paper mâché. The workbench is big and heavy and worn, made from an old church pew. Jars of hardware on the shelves are neatly labeled in block print. There’s a jar that says “FOUND HARDWARE” and another that says “FOUND MONEY”. On the walls and rafters hang various things: a woven pack basket, the tail feathers of a grouse, watercolor artwork of a winter scene, a boat harbor, a sailboat on the ocean in moonlight. In the rafters are lengths of wood, and at one end of the shop is a small loft with a window.

      IVY (V.O.)
      <br>
      <br>
      My father gave beautiful handmade gifts at Christmas. For weeks in December he’d be in his workshop in the evenings, making a nok hockey board or a tiny pair of skis for Molly, my American Girl doll. To communicate with the house, Dad would call our number from the phone in his shop, hang up, let it ring until someone answered, and then pick up the phone again, in order to talk on the same line.

    INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK OUTSIDE
    <br>
    <br>
    WIDE SHOT - Family sits in the living room around the tree. Ivy and Axel (children) are on the floor, Mary (mother) on the futon couch, Arthur (father) stands with his hands in his pockets but bends to gesture to a gift as Axel unwraps it.

      While you were opening his gifts, he would narrate his intentions behind it, apologize for aspects of it, assure you there would be a future improvement to it. It’s really just a hack-job, he would say.
